"""
Fizzbuzz- this will test how well you understand mathematics operations, if statements, and while loops. 
Loop through the numbers 1 to 100. Print out these numbers. If a number is divisible by 3, print "fizz" instead of the number.
If the number is divisible by 5, print buzz instead. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print fizzbuzz. example:
1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz

Please extend this into a function which takes in a number to loop up to,  ie fizzbuzz(200) gives you fizzbuzz 1-200.
